/**
 * An abstract interface that the parser uses to access the source input. This
 * allows us to implement a source that is backed by a string, array, or a
 * node stream.
 *
 * TOKEN is a single token that can be extracted from the source.
 * CHUNK is a collection of tokens that can be extracted from the source.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ```ts
 * class StringSource implements ISource<string, string> {
 *  ...
 * }
 *
 * class ArraySource<A> implements ISource<A, A[]> {
 *  ...
 * }
 * ```

   * The reason we return the new offset instead of a boolean is that some
   * sources (such as a strings) singel tokens can have different lengths.
   * The character 'a' has length 1, but the character 'ðŸ™Š' has length 2.
   *
   * Return values:
   * - `-1` means that the predicate failed
   * - `-2` means the predicate succeeded with a but we are on new line/row
   * - `>= 0` means the predicate succeeded and we are on the same line/row
   *
   * Note: A lot of implementations will probably just return -1 or or the new offset.
   * If you are implementing a source that has a concept of rows and columns, you
   * can return -2 to indicate that the predicate succeeded, but we are on a new
   * line/row.
   *
   * @param predicate - the predicate to use to test the token
   * @param offset -  the offset of the token to look at
   * @returns the new offset if the predicate returns true (or -2), otherwise -1 if it was false
